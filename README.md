The next generation of <a href="https://github.com/Rozumniak/4wd_robot">4wd_robot_v1</a>
<br>The system is based on Raspberry pi 4, Arduino Mega, Kinect for Xbox 360, MPU6050 inertial unit, and motors with encoders for the odometry.

<br>To use it you will need the following packages (most of them should already be installed by default or requested when building the ros_kinect_autopilot packages):
<ul>
  <li>The navigation stack</li>
  <li>The freenect package (for connecting to the Kinect)</li>
  <li>TF, Joint State and Robot State Publishers</li>
  <li>ROSSerial package (for connecting to the Arduino Mega)</li>
  <li>SLAM gmapping</li>
  <li>TEB local planner.</li>
</ul>

This project is still in progress....
